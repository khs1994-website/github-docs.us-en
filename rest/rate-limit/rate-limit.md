## About rate limits

{% data variables.product.company_short %} limits the number of REST API requests that you can make within a specific amount of time. This limit helps prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, and ensures that the API remains available for all users. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api)."
