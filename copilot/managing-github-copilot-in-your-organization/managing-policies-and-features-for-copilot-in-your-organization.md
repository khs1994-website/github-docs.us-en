## About policies for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}

Organization owners can set policies to govern how {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} can be used within the organization. For example, an organization owner can enable or disable the following {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} features{% ifversion ghec %} (unless an enterprise owner has blocked access to these features at the enterprise level){% endif %}:

- Suggestions matching public code{% ifversion ghec %}
- {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} (if your organization has a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} subscription){% endif %}
- {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} in the IDE
- {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli_short %}

The policy settings selected by an organization owner determine the behavior of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} for all organization members that have been granted access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} through the organization.

{% ifversion ghec %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} policies are also managed at the enterprise level. If your organization is part of an enterprise, and explicit settings have been selected at the enterprise level, you cannot override those settings at the organization level. For more information on managing policies at the enterprise level, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise)."

{% endif %}

### Policies for suggestion matching

Organization settings include an option to either allow or block code completion suggestions that match publicly available code. If you choose to block suggestions matching public code, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} will check potential code completion suggestions and the surrounding code of about 150 characters against public code on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. If there is a match, or a near match, the suggestion is not shown.

{% ifversion ghec %}If your enterprise admin has selected **No policy** for suggestion matching at the enterprise level, you can set a suggestion matching policy for your organization.

If an organization member is assigned a seat by multiple organizations with different suggestion matching policies under the same enterprise, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} will use the most restrictive policy.{% endif %}

## Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} features in your organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.copilot.policy-settings %}
1. Use the dropdown options to the right of each feature to enable or disable that feature for your organization.

   For example, to enable or disable suggestion matching, in the "Suggestions matching public code" dropdown, select **Allowed** or **Blocked**.

{% ifversion ghec %}
1. If your organization has a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} subscription and you enable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, the option **Give {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} access to Bing** is displayed. Depending on your enterprise settings, you may be able to enable this option. When this option is enabled, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} will use search results from Bing to answer some questions.
{% endif %}
