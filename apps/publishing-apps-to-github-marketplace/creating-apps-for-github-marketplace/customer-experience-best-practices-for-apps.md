If you follow these best practices it will help you to provide a good customer experience.

## Customer communication

- Marketing materials for the app should accurately represent the app's behavior.
- Apps should include links to user-facing documentation that describe how to set up and use the app.
- Customers should be able to see what type of plan they have in the billing, profile, or account settings section of the app.
- Customers should be able to install and use your app on both a personal account and an organization account. They should be able to view and manage the app on those accounts separately.
