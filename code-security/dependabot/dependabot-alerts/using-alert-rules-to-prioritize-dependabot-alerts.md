## About {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules

{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules allow you to instruct {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} to automatically dismiss or reopen certain alerts, based on complex logic from a variety of contextual criteria.

{% ifversion dependabot-alert-custom-rules-repo-level %}
There are two types of {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules:

- {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated rules
- User-created custom rules

{% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated rules are enabled by default for public repositories and can be opted into for private repositories. However, it's important to note that you cannot modify the {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated rules. With user-created custom rules, you can create your own rules to automatically dismiss or reopen alerts based on your own criteria.{% endif %}

Whilst you may find it useful to auto-dismiss low impact alerts, you can still reopen auto-dismissed alerts and filter to see which alerts have been auto-dismissed. For more information, see "[Managing automatically dismissed alerts](#managing-automatically-dismissed-alerts)."

Additionally, auto-dismissed alerts are still available for reporting and reviewing, and can be auto-reopened if the alert metadata changes, for example:
- If you change the scope of a dependency from development to production.
- If {% data variables.product.company_short %} modifies certain metadata for the related advisory.

Auto-dismissed alerts are defined by the `resolution:auto-dismiss` close reason. Automatic dismissal activity is included in alert webhooks, REST and GraphQL APIs, and the audit log. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/dependabot/alerts)" in the REST API documentation, and the "`repository_vulnerability_alert` " section in "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#repository_vulnerability_alert-category-actions)."

## About {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated rules

{% note %}

**Note:** Automatic dismissal of low impact development alerts is currently only supported for npm.

{% endnote %}

When enabled, the built-in `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule auto-dismisses certain types of vulnerabilities that are found in npm dependencies used in development. These alerts cover cases that feel like false alarms to most developers as the associated vulnerabilities:

- Are unlikely to be exploitable in a developer (non-production or runtime) environment.
- May relate to resource management, programming and logic, and information disclosure issues.
- At worst, have limited effects like slow builds or long-running tests.
- Are not indicative of issues in production.

This {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule includes vulnerabilities relating to resource management, programming and logic, and information disclosure issues. For more information, see "[Publicly disclosed CWEs used by the `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule](#publicly-disclosed-cwes-used-by-the-dismiss-low-impact-alerts-rule)."

Filtering out these low impact alerts allows you to focus on alerts that matter to you, without having to worry about missing potentially high-risk development-scoped alerts.

By default, {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules are enabled on public repositories and disabled for private repositories. Administrators of private repositories can opt in by enabling alert rules for their repository.

### Enabling the  `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule for your private repository

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}You first need to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-dependabot-alerts#managing-dependabot-alerts-for-your-repository)."{% elsif ghes %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for your repository can be enabled or disabled by your enterprise owner. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)."{% endif %}

1. Select **Dismiss low impact alerts**.
1. Click **Save rules**.
{% else %}
1. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}", click **Dismiss low impact alerts**.

{% ifversion dependabot-alert-custom-rules-repo-level %}
## About user-created custom rules

You can create your own {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules based on alert criteria.

- Dependency scope (`devDependency` or `runtime`)
- Package name
- CWE
- Severity
- Patch availability
- Manifest path
- Ecosystem

### Adding a custom rule to your repository

You can add a custom rule to your {% ifversion fpt %}public and private{% elsif ghec or ghes %}public, private, and internal{% endif %} repositories.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-code-security-and-analysis %}
1. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}", click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="The Gear icon" %} close to "{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} rules".

   ![Screenshot of the "Code security and analysis" page for a repository. The gear icon is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-rules-page.png)

1. Click **New ruleset**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Code security and analysis" page for a repository. The gear icon is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-rules-new-ruleset.png)

1. Under "Name", describe what this rule will do.
1. Under "Alert criteria", select the criteria you want to use to filter alerts.
1. Under "Rules", select the action you want to take on alerts that match the criteria.
1. Click **Create rule**.

{% endif %}

## Managing automatically dismissed alerts

You can filter to see which alerts have been auto-dismissed, and you can reopen dismissed alerts.

{% note %}

**Note:** The {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} page defaults to showing open alerts. To filter and view auto-dismissed alerts, you must first clear the `is:open` default filter from the view.

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
1. To filter to see all closed alerts, click **{% octicon "check" aria-hidden="true" %} Closed**. Alternatively, use the `is:closed` filter query in the search bar.

   ![Screenshot of the "Dependabot Alerts" page. A button, labelled "Closed" is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-alerts-closed-tab.png)

1. To see all auto-dismissed alerts, select **Closed as**, then in the dropdown menu, click **Auto-dismissed**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Dependabot Alerts" page. A button, labelled "Closed as" is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-alerts-closed-as.png)

1. To reopen an auto-dismissed alert, to the left of the alert title, click the checkbox adjacent to the alert, then click **Reopen**.
